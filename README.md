# TITANIC MODELLINFG PREDICTOR 
It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.
Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value.
It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.
The random forest classifier can be used to solve for regression or classification problems. 
The random forest algorithm is made up of a collection of decision trees, and each tree in the ensemble is comprised of a data sample drawn from a training set with replacement, called the bootstrap sample.
DecisionTreeClassifier is a class capable of performing multi-class classification on a dataset. 
In case that there are multiple classes with the same and highest probability, the classifier will predict the class with the lowest index amongst those classes.
